## Assumptions

This project is based on the following assumptions:

- Data represents early-stage hiring and employee signals
- Attrition labels are historical, not real-time
- Models prioritize interpretability over maximum accuracy
- Dashboards are used for validation, not automated decision-making
- Insights are intended to support human judgment, not replace it
